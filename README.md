## Description

In this project we start out by creating our own repository. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## Usage
I was able to add semantic values to the tags within the HTML file, but I also wanted to make sure that the site still functioned properly.  
Provided notes within each element to explain the changes made throughout the assignment.
